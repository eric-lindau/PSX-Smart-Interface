# Aerowinx PSX Smart Interface
An interface for Aerowinx PSX that combines inputs from multi-pilot setups that are not mechanically linked

This interface allows the user to define which hardware components serve specific functions as they relate to PSX, combining inputs
logically while interfacing with the main PSX server, updating values as needed.

## Built with
* [JInput](https://github.com/jinput/jinput) - Used to detect and interface with hardware controllers
* [Aerowinx Network](http://aerowinx.com/assets/networkers/Network%20Documentation.txt) - Used to interface with PSX over network (**documentation only**)
